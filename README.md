An interactive, professional visualizer, managing a Binary Search Tree through the following operations:
1. Insert Node
2. Delete Node
3. Search Node
4. Inorder Traversal
5. Preorder Traversal
6. Postorder Traversal

All we do is enter a number and navigate through the following features to manage the tree:
1. Insert/Enter: Adds a new node to the tree with smooth animation ✨
   
2. Delete/Del: Removes a node and intelligently reorganizes the tree (finding successors!) 🗑️

3. Search/S: Traces the path to find if a value exists or not 🔍

4. Random 🎲: Adds a random number to the tree for quick testing.

5. Tree Traversals:
   - Inorder: Left -> Root -> Right
   - Preorder: Root -> Left -> Right
   - Postorder: Left -> Right -> Root

6. Audio Feedback 🔊: Hear the tree! Distinct sounds for visiting, inserting, and finding nodes.

7. Speed Control: Lets you control the speed of the animation steps.

~ There is the visualizer panel in the center with modern SVG nodes that slide into place.

~ On the left side is the Professional Sidebar with all controls and keyboard shortcut hints.

~ On the right side is the Event Log which tracks every operation step-by-step (e.g., "Found 42!", "Inserted 15").

Thank you, have a great day!

Made with human efforts and peace... hehe
